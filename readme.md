### Module 14 homework "Spring Data"

This is homework for Module 14 of JavaDeveloper (14) GoIt course

Going deeper with `Spring` framework. This homework is about Spring Data. Our goal is to take previous project and:
- add `Spring Data` module
- add `H2` DB to keep our notes (instead of collection)
- add `Flyway` library and create migration for our `note` table creation
- Update `Note` to `@Entity`
- Create `NoteRepository` to work with Note entities
- Refactor `NoteService` to store notes in DB (instead of collection)

As in previous HW, our app can be reached [http://localhost:8080/note/list](http://localhost:8080/note/list)
or from index page [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
